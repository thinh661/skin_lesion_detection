# Skin Lesion Detection

This project focuses on detecting skin lesions using deep learning techniques. It utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) model trained on a dataset of skin lesion images to predict the presence of various skin diseases.

## Installation

1. **Clone the project repository:**
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thinh661/skin_lesion_detection.git


2. **Install my model to predict image at:**

   ```bash
    https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nHZFlbhgFqp2LK2hOIbJowLeptJ3pm9f/view?usp=sharing

   
3. **You must fix some url in my code to run. But don't worry, it's easy**
   - Fix the model installed above at line 64 ./server1/build_model.py
   - Fix the model installed above at line 42 ./server1/predict_img.py
  

4. **Install the NodeJS**

5. **Install the requiements.txt**

6. **Now you can RUN it now by terminal**
     ``` bash
     python predict_img.py in ./server1
     npm start in ./demo
**Finally, Open the localhost at port 3000 (http://localhost:3000/) and enjoy them**\
**This process may take you a moment, please wait**\
**If you can't find my model, pls contact me at : (thinh1.work@gmail.com)**\
